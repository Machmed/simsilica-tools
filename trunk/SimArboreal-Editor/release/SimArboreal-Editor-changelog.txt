Revision ???
-------------
- Added an action to save the tree atlas images
    as PNG files.

Revision 126
-------------
- Reworked the FileActionsState to better allow embedding
    in external applications.  Save and load methods were added
    and the buttons are now not added to the UI unless the state
    is enabled.  This should help facilitate a parallel JME SDK
    plug-in effort.


Revision 94
------------
- Moved RollupPanel and TabbedPanel out into Lemur core.
- Moved the builder classes out into the new simsilica-tools Pager
    library.
- Moved PropertyPanel into its own Lemur extension project LemurProps.
- Converted to use the now-standard Lemur 'glass' style with just a few
    local custom extensions.    
- Moved the Builderstate out to the builder project.


Revision 69
-------------
- Added Y offset parameter that is separate from trunk
    height.
- Added LOD support including two mesh reduction strategies:
    Flat-Poly : renders the tree branches as a set of axis-aligned
                billboarded flat quads.
    Impostor : renders a single quad with a view-direction indexed texture.
                (Note: impostors currently don't save properly to the j3o) 
- Better visual separate of child properies in the UI.
- Reorganized UI to include outer rollup panels to separate vis
    settings from tree parameters.
- Added an avatar toggle to the UI.
- Added shadow intensity and lighting direction settings to the
    UI.
- Added a simplified 'drop shadow' filter that can be enabled instead
    of regular shadows.
- File write operations now warn before overwriting existing files.
- Cleaned out the wire frame meshes from the exported j3o during save.
- Renamed the tree geometry elements to make more sense when viewing
    the tree object in something like Scene Composer.        
        

Revision 33
-------------
- Initial release
