Revision 69
-------------
- Added Y offset parameter that is separate from trunk
    height.
- Added LOD support including two mesh reduction strategies:
    Flat-Poly : renders the tree branches as a set of axis-aligned
                billboarded flat quads.
    Impostor : renders a single quad with a view-direction indexed texture.
                (Note: impostors currently don't save properly to the j3o) 
- Better visual separate of child properies in the UI.
- Reorganized UI to include outer rollup panels to separate vis
    settings from tree parameters.
- Added an avatar toggle to the UI.
- Added shadow intensity and lighting direction settings to the
    UI.
- Added a simplified 'drop shadow' filter that can be enabled instead
    of regular shadows.
- File write operations now warn before overwriting existing files.
- Cleaned out the wire frame meshes from the exported j3o during save.
- Renamed the tree geometry elements to make more sense when viewing
    the tree object in something like Scene Composer.
