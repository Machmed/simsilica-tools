Revision 68

- Added additional mesh generators for different levels of detail.
    Flat-Poly : renders the tree branches as a set of axis-aligned
                billboarded flat quads.
    Impostor : renders a single quad with a view-direction indexed texture. 
- Refactored how branch curves are calculated.
- Added LevelOfDetail parameters object and added it to TreeParamaters.
- Fixed a texture mapping bug that caused a small seam on branches.
- Added a simple LOD control (LodSwitchControl) that can be used to switch
    between tree LODs.
