Revision ???
--------------
-Added scattering support to all of the tree-related materials.
    Note: now SimArboreal trees require the SimFX asset jar: simfx-assets.jar
-Added a distance based alpha-fill to the leaf material.  Needs some tweaking
    but it helps round out transitions between near/far and keeps alpha
    halos from appearing as badly when up close.    


Revision 141
-------------
-Added wind support to the tree materials.


Revision 93
------------
-Fixed a typo in the LeafNormal.vert shader that was causing the shader to fail
	on some platforms.


Revision 68
------------
- Added additional mesh generators for different levels of detail.
    Flat-Poly : renders the tree branches as a set of axis-aligned
                billboarded flat quads.
    Impostor : renders a single quad with a view-direction indexed texture. 
- Refactored how branch curves are calculated.
- Added LevelOfDetail parameters object and added it to TreeParamaters.
- Fixed a texture mapping bug that caused a small seam on branches.
- Added a simple LOD control (LodSwitchControl) that can be used to switch
    between tree LODs.


Revision 33
-------------
- Initial release
